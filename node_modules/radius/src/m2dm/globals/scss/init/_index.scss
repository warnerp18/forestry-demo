   *  Responsive typography allows us to scale the font proportionally to the available screen width. Also, because we declare all component dimensions in rem units and/or percentages, the UI elements will scale along with the font. This means that we can partially mitigate the "stripiness" issue on large screens where main content has a max-width and is surrounded by large full bleed stripes of background colour, and we make sure the text remains comfortably legible.
   *  
   *  The current formula has been derived by taking two common screen resolutions, finding a good font size for those and finding the equation of a line connecting the two using the slope-intercept formula.
   *  
   *  So, given the points:
   *    - for 1280px => 16px
   *    - for 1920px => 20px
   *  
   *  we can find the slope of the curve:
   *  ```
   *  slope = (20 - 16) / (1920 - 1280)
   *  slope =  1/160
   *  ```
   *  
   *  From this, we can find the intercept:
   *  ```
   *  intercept = 16 - (1280 * (1/160))
   *  intercept = 8
   *  ```
   *  
   *  Therefore giving us an equation for screen sizes greater than 1280px:
   *  ```
   *  font-size = screen-width / 160 + 8
   *  ```
   *  
   *  In CSS, `screen-width` can be substituted with `100vh` therefore giving us our responsive typography formula.
   *  
   *  QED
