* description: |
*   The main typeface for section headings is `Amasis MT`. Section headings have 3 variants: `--large`, `--medium` and `--small` responsible for controlling the font size. The `--large` variant is used to convey singular, bold brand messages, while the `--medium` variant is used to accomodate more content when there's more information to convey.
