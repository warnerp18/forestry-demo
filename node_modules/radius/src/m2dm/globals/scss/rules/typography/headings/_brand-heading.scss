 *
 * description: |
 *  Styled header with brand (self made) font and colored with brand color. Can take an accent if 
 *  configured to do so. Can be both left or center aligned according to configuration.
 *   
 *  ### Element
 *     - `brand-heading`: header with brand font and brand color (purple). Adjusts in size with viewport.
 *     There is a specific modifier for the brand-hero brand-heading--hero which is responsible for the color and adding a new size for larger breakpoints. There is also a modifier class brand-heading--small for use in long German words, which is responsible for amending the font-size across different breakpoints.
 *      
 *     
 *  ### Variations:
 *     - `text-block__heading-bar--brand`: Puts an accent below the header
 *     - `text-block--center`: If on an ancestor element of header el, header text and any accent will be centered.
 *     - `brand-heading--hero`: for using within the brand hero
 *     - `brand-heading--small`: for using within the brand hero, with long words.
 *     - `u-color-white`: modifier added to change text color from default on a dark background.
