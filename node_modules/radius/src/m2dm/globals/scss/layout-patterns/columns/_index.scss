  * title: Columns
  *
  * purpose: Use to split an element into multiple non-empty columns.
  *
  * description: |
  *   For more fine tuned layouts, you can use the mixin and generate more complex layouts between custom breakpoints. This can be used together with `breakpoints()` mixin as it just generates the widths. The columns will live inside our page grid (more here: `layout-patterns/page-grid`).
  *
  *   The mixin has to be applied on the wrapper of the columns. Adding a comma in the list will generate a new row.
  *
  * sassUsage: |
  *
  *    // columns mixin adds default padding to each column
  *    @include columns(3 2 1);
  *    // columns-no-padding mixin does not add default padding to each column
  *    @include columns-no-padding(3 2 1);
