 * title: Grid 1-4-1
 *
 * description: |
 *   This grid splits the content into a 1:4:1 grid - setting the left and right margins of a floating column that holds the content. The margins are dependent on the "width" of the column itself following the golden ratio proportions (more here: `dependencies/grid`).<br>
 *
 *   This is applied to make the content "narrower" in width and should sit inside an `u-page-grid` layout (see: `layout-patterns/page-grid`).<br>
 *
 *   To ensure an element follows the 'page' grid, an utility class needs to be added (see below).<br>
 *
 *   The utility class makes use of the `golden-ratio-paddings` mixin which is part of _`rs-golden-ratio-grid`_ project imported in Radius as a node module. The mixin is called with 3 parameters, first one representing the column width proportion related to the full width, next two setting the left, respectively the right margin (as proportions).<br>
 *
 *   For the 'inner' grid purposes these parameters are set to `(4,1,1)`.<br>
 *
 *   This is not applied on small screens where the content goes back to full width.
