 * title: Predefined grid classes
 *
 * purpose: Use to build organic layouts with predefined grid classes for fast prototyping.
 *
 * description: |
 *
 *   To get started you need to add the wrapper class `.col-[s/m/l/xl]-wrapper` to make your inner divs into columns and have proper alignment and padding between them (only one class is needed, so if you use `.col-s-wrapper` the others are not required). If you only add `.col-xl-wrapper`, it means that it will create your grid system only starting from extra large devices onwards.<br><br>
 *
 *   Inside the wrapper class specify the desired proportion of the column with classes `.col-[s/m/l/xl]-[1-8]` (e.g. `.col-m-3` will apply a proportion of 3 on the column from medium screen onwards). The approach is mobile-first, where the small columns will be applied across all resolutions unless another class for a bigger breakpoint is applied. <br><br>
 *
 *   The available proportions are between 1 and 8 (1 is the smallest proportion, 8 is the biggest). Each column proportion is dependent on the siblings proportions. For example, two elements with class `.col-s-1` will display two *equal* columns.<br><br>
 *
 *   The predefined grid classes are split into 4 categories:<br>
 *
 *     - `[.col]-s-[proportion]` : small device width &lt; 480px
 *     - `[.col]-m-[proportion]` : medium device width &gt;= 480px
 *     - `[.col]-l-[proportion]` : large device width &gt;= 800px
 *     - `[.col]-xl-[proportion]` : extra large device width &gt;= 1200px
