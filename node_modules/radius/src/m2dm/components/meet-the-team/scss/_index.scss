 *
 * purpose: Use to convey trust and security to the user about a given project / company and provide an overview of the people behind the scenes.
 *
 * description: |
 *  Consists of a list of team members and a detail panel.
 *
 *  The list of team members are arranged in a grid whose column span varies with the width of the viewport (ranging from 5 columns on large devices to 3 on medium sized screens and 2 on small devices).
 *  
 *  The detail panel just handles the layout and is expected to be inserted into a modal window.
 *  
 *  **This component is very closely aligned to the profile component and modal component.** The profile component is expected to fill in the grid and provide a bunch of faces, names, and job titles, and the modal is used to display the detail panel for each team member.
