 *
 * description: |
 *   A tab provides the affordance for displaying grouped content. A tab label succinctly describes the tabâ€™s associated grouping of content.
 *   
 *   Tabs enable content organization at a high level, such as switching between views, data sets, or functional aspects of an app.
 *   
 *   The default layout for the tabs is horizontal across all screen sizes and is designed to be used with a small number of groups of content (typically 3 or less).
 *
 * modifiers:
 *   tabs--vertical: This variant should be used when a large number of content groups is needed (more than 3). This variant will fallback to the horizontal layout on mobile to make better use of available space
