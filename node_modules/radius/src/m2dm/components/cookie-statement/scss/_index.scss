 * description: |
 *   Cookie statement is designed to be used as a stand alone section, that appears fixed at the bottom of the viewport and remains fixed to the bottom of the viewport as the user scrolls. 
 *   
 *   Until users provide consent by selecting the 'Accept and dismiss` CTA.
 *
 *   The javascript is triggered by the addition of the attribute [data-js-cookie-statement].
 *   In order to deal with different countries (folders) on the same domain we need to add the attribute [data-js-cookie-statement-path="/"] in order to separate cookies for different folders on the same URL.
