/**
 * section: M2DM/components/forms/select
 * title: Select
 *
 * purpose: Use to provide the user with a menu of more than 6 pre-defined options.
 *
 * description: |
 *  Displaying more than 6 options at once would overwhelm the user, risking choice paralysis and crowding the UI. To simplify the experience, the select component only shows these options once the user requests them.<br><br>
 *
 *   The select component is composed of:
 *   <ul>
 *      <li>A **label** that introduces a theme or question to which the user chooses from the list of options to answer.</li>
 *      <li>A **select** field that includes placeholder text to indicate the action required from the user (usually 'Select one').</li>
 *      <li>A **field status** that indicates when there is a change in the field's status such as validation errors (the field status is visible only if an error is reported).</li>
 *   </ul>
 *
 *   ### Select validation:
 *   The select components from `.form-element__elements` set the state class **is-error** or **is-success** on the form element (e.g. `.form-element`) and all children should react accordingly.
 *
 *
 * modifiers:
 *   is-error: The class should be applied on the `.form-element` element if the select has an error. This status class is part of the negative validation and it is responsible for changing the visibility of the `field status` and changing the appearance of the whole `select` and *label*.
 *   is-success: The class should be applied on the `.form-element` element if the select is valid. This status class is part of the positive validation providing user with encouraging feedback when  choosing one of the available options. It is responsible for changing the visibility of the icons that accompanies the *label* (*e.g.* green tick icon).
