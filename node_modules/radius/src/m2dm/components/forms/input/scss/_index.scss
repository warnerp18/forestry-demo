/**
 * section: M2DM/components/forms/input
 * title: Input
 *
 * purpose: Use to collect data from users and confirm the validity, formatting or completeness of the data that they enter.
 *
 * description: |
 *   The input component is composed of:
 *   <ul>
 *      <li>A **label** that introduces what data is required to be entered by the user. The label is accompanied by visual helpers (icons) that are hidden by default. The icons become visible when the validation (positive/negative) of the labeled control occurs.</li>
 *      <li>An **input** field that may or may not include placeholder text to provide guidance on the type or formatting of data that is to be entered (the input can be of different types, *e.g.* email, password, checkbox, number etc.)</li>
 *      <li>A **field status** that indicates when there is a change in the field's status such as validation errors (the field status is visible only if an error is reported).</li>
 *   </ul>
 *
 *
 *   ### Input validation:
 *   The input components inside `.form-element__elements` set the state class **is-error** or **is-success** on the form element (e.g. `.form-element`) and all children should react accordingly.
 *
 * modifiers:
 *   is-error: The class should be applied on the `.form-element` element if the input has an error. This status class is part of the negative validation and it is responsible for changing the visibility of the `field status` and changing the appearance of the whole `input` field and *label*.
 *   is-success: The class should be applied on the `.form-element` element if the input is valid. This status class is part of the positive validation signaling that the information provided fulfilled field's requirements. It is responsible for changing the visibility of the icons that accompanies the *input* field.
