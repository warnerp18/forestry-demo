/**
 * section: M2DM/components/progress
 * title: Progress
 *
 * activateComponent: radius-component-progress
 *
 * purpose: Use to display the progress of a task or to represent advancement towards a total.
 *
 * description: |
 *   ### Context:
 *     This component can sit within other components, it runs full width of the space it occupies.
 * 
 *   ### Behaviour:
 *     - The speed of progress is determined by the task.
 *     - The indicator should always fill from 0% to 100%, in instances where progress has been made off view, the active progress should be animated from left to right.
 * 
 *   ### Elements:
 *     - `.progress`: This is the main element in which indicates the length of the progress to complete.
 *       - `.is-complete`: This is the state class which indicates when the progress bar is complete. This is to be applied to any ancestor of the `.progress` element or the `.progress` element itself.
 *     - `.progress__activity`: This is the element which represents the current progress of the activity. This is where you apply an inline width (`style="width: 50%;"`) to represent the progress.
 * 
 *   ### Use the input to test the progress bar:
 *     <input type="number" value="50" min="0" max="100" data-js-progress-percentage/>%
