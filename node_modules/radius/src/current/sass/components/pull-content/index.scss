 *
 * description: |
 *   This component allows for a content box that toggles between full width and float depending on screen-size.<br><br>
 *
 *   It consists of three basic elements:<br>
 *   pull-content-wrap<br>
 *   pull-content<br>
 *   main-content (optional)<br><br>
 *
 *   The main content can be further customised by adding more classes or replacing the `.main-content` class altogether as it isn't used by Radius.<br><br>
 *
 *   The breakpoint is `tablet-medium`
 *
 *
 * modifiers:
 *   pull-content--sm: Add this modifier to the pull-content-wrap element to create a small pull-content container (Golden Ratio => 7 5)
 *   pull-content--m: Add this modifier to the pull-content-wrap element to create a medium pull-content container (Golden Ratio => 7 6)
 *
 * markup: components/pull-content/pull-content
